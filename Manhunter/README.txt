Manhunter is a python program that I made just to practice with selenium and python. 
The program accesses linkedIn, searches up all the names in the query.txt file, 
and records their information into a .txt file. 
In order to start, type every name you want to be searched into the query file separated with a newline.
The program will then log all of the information into text files. 

Ensure that your LinkedIn username and password are recorded in the variables:
USER
PASS

The program has a tendency to crash due to what I surmise to be internet speed.
The only way I know to fix this is with wait timers, and even then it is inconsistent.
You may have to run it a few times if your internet is being mean...

The program has a way to detect re-captchas, but not to solve them.
Therefore, if it hits a re-captcha, it will pause for you to solve it. 
Once you solve it, wait a second or two and hit enter.

Have fun!
